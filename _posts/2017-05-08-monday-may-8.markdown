### Progress

A lot of refactoring in my Vue components were needed today. I was able to dynamically generate pagination links on the guide step edit page.

### Thoughts

VueJS provides a really nice workflow and the debugging capabilities are more impressive than I anticipated. I have not really had to rely on `console.log()` very much at all, which is nice.
