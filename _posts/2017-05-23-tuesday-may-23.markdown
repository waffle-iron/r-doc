### Progress

I recreated the login page (functionality is not currently working, but is on my todo list), and created a home page. I was able to utilize some VueJS specific plugins that allowed me to add a nice front-end pagination to the home page. Implemented `vue-router` so the front-end is not a single-page application. That means that the client is completely separated from the server. When you click on a link on the page, JavaScript is handling the page redirect and page generation. This is a new, modern approach to building web applications.

### Thoughts 

I believe that I have figured out a path forward with my site structure and design. It did take a few hours of thought. A little bit of trial and error was needed as well. I've noticed recently that I will decide on an approach, try it out, find out that it is not ideal for my goals and then do a reset back to the prior commit, which erases any trace of me trying that idea. On paper, once again, this makes it look like I am not making any progress. There is a way for me to revert a commit and place it ahead of the attempted changes. I need to look into that when I encounter that situation again.

I have provided screenshots today of the new look of my pages. I'm not entirely sure on the black and white theme at the moment, but I am still in the stage of molding the look and feel to my tasted. I suppose that storyboards would have been more appropriate at this stage. I like to create my storyboards with HTML, but I am going to look into some third-party tools that will help me to accomplish this instead of simply hacking away at HTML.
