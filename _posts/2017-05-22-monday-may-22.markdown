### Progress

I polished up the api endpoints to be able to retrieve information from the server so that the front end pages can access that information using AJAX calls. The data is being displayed precisely how I want it to. Spent more time getting the tests to work after the fact, than implementing the actual feature.

### Thoughts 

I hit quite a writers block of sorts today. I am very unsure of what approach to take in terms of front-end redesign. I do not want to use my mockup designs because I used an existing page and recreated it. While I do consider this to be an acceptable approach (because the process does allow me to make it unique and my own), I did not want to do this for my project. I would like the front-end and the back-end to be built from the ground up with my own unique design. Unfortunately, because I lacked a clear vision on how to proceed with the redesign, I had to take some time to figure that out. This meant that on paper, I did not accomplish very much today.
