### Progress

A bit of behind the scenes work today as I try to figure out how to approach setting up and configuring the database. I composed an entity-relationship diagram (seen in the image above) that is a work in progress as I begin determinging what tables and relationships I am going to need in order to keep the database as normalized as possible without duplication. I also installed a couple of helpful tools that will help me when I begin reworking the front-end. That won't be for a little while though. Finally, I began writing tests to make sure that what I am building does in fact work as I am anticipating.

### Thoughts 

I realized that it is now time to begin shifting fully to the back-end implementation. It is also imperative that my production environment always be in a presentable state. I will now begin development changes on separate git branches.
