<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>

<p>I reached out to my host’s limited support to try to resolve the issue that I am having not being able to push any commits to them. Unfortunately, I was not able to get much of a response before they closed for the day. They’re in Germany, so I have to compete with the time difference. I attempted to use SFTP to connect to the host but was not successful in connecting. I did not spend a lot of time with that, but it’s beginning to look like an alternative that I will have to explore if I cannot get this resolved by the weekend.</p>

<p>I completed all of the database seeds. I am now able to generate a large amount of fake data that I can now design the front-end around. This also means that my production environment will be able to use this data in order to display my work (once I get it working again).</p>

<p>I hit somewhat of a brick wall after completing the database seeding task. The next thing I would like to work on is the CRUD interaction from the front-end to the back-end. I’m realizing quickly that it is going to take a bit of strategy to get started. Because a single documentation guide contains a lot of different information from many different database tables, structuring my tests to account for this is not as simple as I originally thought.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>The first screenshot above shows a database seed generator for all of the steps that will be included in a given guide. The following two are a small snapshot into what the internal database looks like when it is populated. While I am happy with the code that I wrote in the displayed seed file, it is really messy. I think it would be beneficial for me to take some time to refactor this so that if I come back to this a year from now, I’ll be able to make sense of what I did. I also have it configured to generate between 7 and 15 steps for 200 different guides. I did not include any way of changing that number without already having to know where to change what numbers in order to generate a different number. Especially if somebody else down the road were to look at this, i can only imagine that it looks like a mess.</p>
