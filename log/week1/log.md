## Day 1: Monday, May 8, 2017

**Progress**: A lot of refactoring in my Vue components were needed today. I was able to dynimaclly generate pagination links on the guide step edit page.

**Thoughts**: VueJS provides a really nice workflow and the debugging capabilities are more impressive than I anticipated. I have not really had to rely on `console.log()` very much at all, which is nice.
